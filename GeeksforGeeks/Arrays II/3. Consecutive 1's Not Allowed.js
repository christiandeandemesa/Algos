    To illustrate the above:
    If N = 3, then A = [1] and B = [1]. This symbolizes that if the binary string was one character (A[0] or B[0]), then they each have one option: 0 or 1.
    After the first for loop, A = [1, 2] and B = [1, 1]. This symbolizes that if the binary string was two characters (A[1] or B[1]), then A has two options: 00 and 10
    and B has one option: 10.
    After the second for loop, A = [1, 2, 3] and B = [1, 1, 2]. This symbolizes that if the binary string was three characters (A[2] or B[2]), then A has three options:
    000, 010, 100 and B has two options: 001 and 101.
    Then the for loop breaks and we return the sum of A's last element (A[N - 1]) and B's last element (B[N - 1]), which is 5.
